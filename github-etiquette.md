# GitHub Rules and Etiquette

- Keep file paths short and sensible.
- Donâ€™t use funky characters and spaces in your file names, these cause trouble because of differences in Mac/Windows system
- Always pull before you start working on your project or push in case someone has edited the work since the last time you pulled.
